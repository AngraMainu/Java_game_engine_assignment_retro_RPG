2) Reading data from files to build level location.
3) Combat.
4) Interaction with objects using items.
5) GUI.

List of tools for the implementation:
1) Java Swing/awt.

UPD 27/04/2022:

Decided to work using Swing library since i couldn't find any good and up to date tutorials on JavaFX.
Learning how to create game engine based off of a guide. Uploading my work here just to show that i'm working on the project.
Whatever code is taken frome the guide, WILL BE CHANGED. I repeat, i plan to take NO CODE from the guide and claim it as my own, it is strictly a studying material for me to understand what it's all about.
