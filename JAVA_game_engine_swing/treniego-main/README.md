Reposetory for my personal Java assignment. 
Choosen topic: Game engine for a real-time RPG. 

The game engine must have implemented:
1) Reading data from files to fill implementation of inventory and further systems.
2) Reading data from files to build level location.
3) Combat.
4) Interaction with objects using items.
5) GUI.

List of tools for the implementation:
1) Java Swing/awt.
2) Maven (recommended).

WIP, subject to change depending on personal consultation with my teacher.

UPD 15/04/2022:
Reworked diagram after more research. It is, however, still not perfect since this is my first time creating one, and it's quite complicated due to all the different relationship between classes.
The diagram is not 100% accurate to the structure of empty-body classes. That is because when i write diagram first i can forget about something, or when i create the structure in IntelliJ i get a better idea of structurising the classes. 
*!*Free diagram services do not let me edit or save project so i'm forced to make one entirely from scratch even if i have to change just one small detail.

UPD 27/04/2022:

Decided to work using Swing library since i couldn't find any good and up to date tutorials on JavaFX.
Learning how to create game engine based off of a guide. Uploading my work here just to show that i'm working on the project.
Whatever code is taken frome the guide, WILL BE CHANGED. I repeat, i plan to take NO CODE from the guide and claim it as my own, it is strictly a studying material for me to understand what it's all about.
